This is my first project in Rust!

This program is a CLI music player, utilizing the `{rodio, serde}` crates.

## Features (Current Version)

## Future Enhancements

- Add playlists
- Add mpk (music package)
- Install songs from different platforms and immediately add them to a playlist
- Convert video (mp4) to music (mp3) with easy playlist addition
- Listen to music together, even with large groups
    - If group listening is added, also add voice chat for singing together
- Add speech recognition
